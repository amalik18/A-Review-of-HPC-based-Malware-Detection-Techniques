For the last decade, researchers and companies have begun to use Hardware Performance Counters (HPC), which are already present on processors, as a safety measure to aid in malware detection. HPCs provide a zero-cost solution for security making it a very attractive solution. A very prominent instance of HPCs being used for security is Intel's Thread Detection Technology (TDT) which gets dually used by Microsoft Endpoint \cite{main}. This paper analyzes important HPC centric research papers and showcases the improvements to malware detection using these very HPCs.
